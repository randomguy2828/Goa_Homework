    <P>inline ccs is most priority css its writed straight in any tag</P>
    <P>internal css is when you write scc in head tag which then writes to every tag in body which you wanted css for and its a second priority after inline</P>
    <p>and for last is external css for it you create a css file and then you allign it with html file as you give different tags a different values in external css,
 it shows in html which is why its most used as you dont need to scroll up and down and it has lowest priority out of this three</p>

 <p>now to priorities, storngest priority has inline style which when is writed cant be changed by id, classes or elements,
     so there is no way to change inline style using other type of styles, you can die on it but it wont change,
     id is second best in priority it can be changed by inline but cant be changed by classes or elements and it also uses # so you can use id,
    now to clases is third best in priority,
while elements are the worst one in priority</p>
